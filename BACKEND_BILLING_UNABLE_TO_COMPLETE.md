# Billing items not fully completed

1. Live integration verification against real Stripe and Clerk environments was not completed in this workspace because no live credentials/endpoints were provided.
2. End-to-end webhook delivery validation from Stripe to this running server instance was not completed (tests use mocked Stripe/Clerk calls).
